### Usage
```
tlb-sim config_file trace_dir benchmark weight_file [mapping_file]
```
The mapping_file parameter is not required for simulation without sub-ranges.

### TLB configuration
Please refer to the example config file in example-cfg folder

### Contents of the trace
The instruction and function call trace is extracted by PIN (pintool/trace.cpp). This pintool recieves a weight file to determine where to extract instructions. There is an example weight file, example-trace/657.xz.weight. The weight file is generated by SimPoints. It records the start and end points of program segments that should be traced. 

The pintool generates a binary-form trace. The memory accessing addresses in this trace file don't have tags. To generate tagged traces, you need to run the pre=process program in the preprocess/ folder. The details of a trace can be found in simulator.cpp.
